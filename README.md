# TurretRotationExample
TurretRotationExample shows how to apply rotation over time to 2 parts turret with limited agle for each axis (Vertical & Horizontal).

I'm not a pro coder or anything, just trying to help eveyone esle strugling with the same problems I've encoutered.
So if you have any suggestions how to improve this example, code in it, etc let me know.
